This Codeigniter project is listing (not Mysql's default databases like "information_schema" etc.) and exporting (multi) your databases on your current server (the server that, this project working on). In the end exported databases is ready to import to Mysql server. Detailed and visualized document will be added very soon.


Todo List:

-Backup with cron.

-Option to user: Delete some databases after a time (delete xxx.sql after 1 month)

-Option to user: Download databases to current computer as zip archive (Since browsers wont let user to download 10 things in same time). After that dump download maybe i can delete backup files from server to avoid duplicate backup files.
